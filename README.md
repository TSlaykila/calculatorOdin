# calculatorOdin

This is a simple calculator built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The project is designed to solidify my understanding of fundamental programming concepts, DOM manipulation, and user interface design.

### Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Interactive Display**: Updates dynamically as users interact with the calculator.
- **Clear Button**: Resets all values and starts fresh.
- **Operate Function**: Executes calculations based on user inputs.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents issues like dividing by zero or pressing multiple operators consecutively.
- **Snarky Error Messages**: Displays witty feedback for invalid operations.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability on different devices and screen sizes.

### Advanced Features (Extra Credit)

- **Decimal Input**: Allows users to input floating-point numbers, with safeguards against invalid formats.
- **Backspace Button**: Enables undoing the last input.
- **Keyboard Support**: Adds compatibility with keyboard inputs for enhanced accessibility.

### What I'll Be Using

- **JavaScript**: To create functions for mathematical operations, handle logic, and interact with the DOM.
- **HTML**: To structure the calculator interface and layout.
- **CSS**: To style the calculator and ensure a clean, user-friendly design.
- **Event Listeners**: To handle user interactions like button clicks and keyboard inputs.
- **Debugging Tools**: To test functionality and fix issues, such as edge cases and logical errors.
